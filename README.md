# Image classification using Neural Networks


In this project, we'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. We'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. We'll build a convolutional, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers. 
At the end, we'll see neural network's predictions on the sample images.
